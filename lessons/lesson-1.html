    <h2>Lesson 1: The Simplest Neuron</h2>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the absolute basic components of a neuron: inputs, weights, and a bias.</li>
        <li>Learn how a neuron combines these components to produce an output (the "forward pass").</li>
        <li>Relate the function of a simple neuron to the familiar algebraic equation <code>y = mx + c</code>.</li>
        <li>Write a complete C++ program to model a single neuron and make a prediction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Theory</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the heart of neural networks! At its core, a single neuron (or "perceptron") is just a simple computational unit. It's a concept you're likely already familiar with from basic algebra.</p>
    <p>Remember the equation for a straight line? <code>y = mx + c</code>. In neural network terminology, <code>x</code> is the <strong>input</strong>, <code>m</code> becomes the <strong>weight</strong>, <code>c</code> becomes the <strong>bias</strong>, and <code>y</code> is our <strong>output</strong>.</p>
    <p>The formula is transformed into: <code>output = (weight * input) + bias</code>. This process of taking inputs and calculating an output is called the <strong>Forward Pass</strong>.</p>
    
    <h3>Code Example</h3>
    <p>This program will predict the price of a pizza based on its size. Our simple "model" has a base price (the bias) and a price per inch (the weight).</p>
